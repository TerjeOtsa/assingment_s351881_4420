1.1 Identify and Fix Logical Errors
The original code has one key issue: it uses a mutable default argument (prime_factors=[]),
which causes unexpected behavior in repeated function calls. Specifically,
this leads to accumulation of previous results when calling the function multiple times, resulting in incorrect outputs.

1.2 Test with Various Inputs
Here’s a comparison of test cases with both versions of the code:

Input 1:
Original: [] (correct)
New: [] (correct)
Input 56 (Prime factorization: 2 × 2 × 2 × 7):
Original: [2, 2, 2, 7] (correct)
New: [2, 2, 2, 7] (correct)
Input 97 (Prime number):
Original: [2, 2, 2, 7, 97] (incorrect)
New: [97] (correct)
Input 100 (Prime factorization: 2 × 2 × 5 × 5):
Original: [2, 2, 2, 7, 97, 2, 2, 5, 5] (incorrect)
New: [2, 2, 5, 5] (correct)
Input 8688 (Prime factorization: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 181):
Original: [2, 2, 2, 7, 97, 2, 2, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 181] (incorrect)
New: [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 181] (correct)
Input 8689 (Prime number):
Original: [2, 2, 2, 7, 97, 2, 2, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 181, 8689] (incorrect)
New: [8689] (correct)

Part 2: Optimize the Code
The optimization goal here is to make the function more efficient, especially for large numbers, and improve readability.

2.1 Reduce Number of Divisions and Loop Iterations
Optimization:
Even Numbers: We handle the factor 2 separately using a loop before moving on to odd numbers. This eliminates unnecessary checks for even divisors in the main loop.
Odd Numbers: After factoring out all 2s, we only check odd divisors (starting from 3), skipping even numbers, which reduces the number of iterations in the main loop.
Time Complexity:
Original Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n)) due to the loop iterating up to sqrt(n). However, it unnecessarily checks even numbers after the first few iterations, which could lead to slightly more iterations.
Optimized Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n)), but with fewer iterations because we skip even numbers after handling the factor 2.

Part 3: Explanation of Changes
3.1 Bugs Fixed:
Mutable Default Argument: The biggest bug was using a mutable default argument (prime_factors=[]). By switching to prime_factors=None and initializing the list inside the function, we fixed the issue of lists being shared between function calls, which caused accumulated and incorrect results.
3.2 Optimization Explanation:
Handling Factor 2 Separately: By factoring out 2 first, we reduce the number of iterations needed in the main loop. The remaining number is guaranteed to be odd, so we can skip checking even divisors.
Incrementing by 2: We increment the loop variable by 2 after handling the factor of 2, effectively skipping even numbers and improving performance.
3.3 Performance Improvements:
Fewer Iterations: Skipping even numbers reduces the number of unnecessary divisions, which improves performance for larger inputs.
Simpler Logic: The code is easier to understand because it separates the handling of the factor 2 from the general prime factorization logic.
